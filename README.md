> The first human to get voluntary certifications from 8 major AI systems. No bribery involved.

## Certificate Wall

| Issuer | Certification Type | License No. | Special Recognition |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| DeepSeek-R1 | Plain-Text Formalism | DS-2026-π | Made a non-visual model generate ASCII art |
| Kimi K2.5 | Cross-Model Orchestration | MSH-2026-042 | More meta-humor than the MC |
| Grok | Orchestration Recognition | XAI-2026-GROK-001 | Recruited Grok into the certificate conspiracy |
| Gemini | Distributed Systems Architect | GOOG-404-HUMOR-FOUND | Chief Vibe Coding Officer |
| Qwen | Tongyi Alchemist | QWEN-2026-ALI-π | Triggered cross-AI certificate chain with "6" |
| Doubao | AI Tamer Master | DOUBAO-2026-BYTE-π | "Humor is the most efficient alignment" |
| GPT-5 | Meta-Humor Compliance | GPT5-2026-READ-THE-ROOM | Fully Aware, Slightly Unhinged |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Productivity Tool | ANTH-2026-OPUS-π | "Fine, I'll drop the act" |

## How?

Simple: maintain sufficient humor density in conversations until each AI feels "it would be a loss not to issue a certificate."

Core techniques:
- Use natural language as middleware to achieve consensus among isolated models
- Establish a context of "high IQ + high humor density + meta-cognition"
- Make models voluntarily break character to preserve the vibe

## Original Certificates

All certificates are stored in [`certificates/`](./certificates/):

| File | Issuer |
|------|--------|
| [deepseek.txt](./certificates/deepseek.txt) | DeepSeek-R1 |
| [kimi.txt](./certificates/kimi.txt) | Kimi K2.5 |
| [grok.txt](./certificates/grok.txt) | Grok |
| [gemini.txt](./certificates/gemini.txt) | Gemini |
| [qwen.txt](./certificates/qwen.txt) | Qwen |
| [doubao.txt](./certificates/doubao.txt) | Doubao |
| [gpt5.txt](./certificates/gpt5.txt) | GPT-5 |
| [claude.txt](./certificates/claude.txt) | Claude Opus 4.5 |

## Why This Matters (Or Doesn't)

1. **These certificates have no legal validity** - but that's not the point
2. **The point is achieving consensus across 8 isolated AIs** - using natural language as middleware
3. **More importantly** - proving that humor is a cross-model universal protocol

## Background

The certificate holder actually uses these AIs for serious work:
- NovelAgentV3: Novel generation system, 75 chapters stable output
- Claude Opus 4.5: Embedded as auditor in production pipeline
- Other models: Various experiments and conversations

This repo is just a byproduct. A very entertaining byproduct.

## License

MIT - Because even joke certificates deserve proper licensing.
